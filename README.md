# portfolio
This is a website I made for an assignment while a student at SMASH academy. This is NOT my real portfolio website. I plan to make a more professional one this 
summer to showcase the projects I've done. When I was making this project I was messing around thats why it might not seem super professional. What I am proud of
however was learning enough CSS at a young age to be able to replicate the look and feel of the Apple website. That is were a lot of inspiration for the simple 
clean design came from.
