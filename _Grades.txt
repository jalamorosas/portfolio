Assignment: Use CSS ID selectors to style two paragraphs on your About Me page differently.

Grade: 80

Comment: You do have separate ID selectors but the assignment was use them to style the paragraphs separately, which you don't have.  You did get extra credit, however, because I see that you clearly understand how to use CSS selectors, and you've used them well in other sections.

Assignment: Add an image to your About Me page and edit the CSS so the image and paragraphs are side-by-side.

Grade:  80

Comment: I see that you did use the floats to try to position your image and paragraphs, but because of the extra CSS selectors you have in there, it wasn't working.  You probably need to add float and width properties to your .text CSS selector to fix that.
