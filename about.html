            <p>My name is Julian Alamo-Rosas. I am a Latino student at SMASH Wharton. I am very interested in programming and
                soccer. I program in my free time so that is one of the reasons my website is very advanced. For my project
                I'm researching an infectious disease called anthrax.</p>

                Hi, I am an Albanian virus but because of poor technology in my country unfortunately I am not able to harm your computer.
                Please be so kind to delete one of your important files yourself and then forward me other users. Many thanks
                for your cooperation! Best regards, Albanian virus

                Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of high school. They think
                I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's
                office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good
                candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st
                in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting
                Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian
                at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter
                and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says
                "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished...
                I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile
                "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the
                secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked
                their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals
                there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)
